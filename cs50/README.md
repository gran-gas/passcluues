Hello! My name is Gast√≥n Frasca, I'm from Mendoza, Argentina, and I developed "Logged" for the cs50 final project. 
My native language it's not English so be sure, you gonna see some errors along the way.

-----------------------------------LOGGED----------------------------------

 So, let's begin, the idea behind Logged is to make a web tool for keeping track of your site's logs in a more private, customizable and anonymous way. 
 Every time you register in a new site, you create a password and a username, most of the time we forget that user and password ( or even the reason why we register there!) and we must go through the process of entering a new key and user. 
Logged works like a preventive medicine for that situation, now when you register in a new site, open your Logged session and enter: the site name, keywords of your username and password (Not the actual password!) and a description of why you register, so in the future, if you forget any of that, Logged will be your reminder. 
Also Logged can be your more customizable browser home page! as you can select a site, remember your keywords and why are you registered there, open its URL, all in one click!

-------------------------- Access Key and Log In ---------------------------

 As you open Logged an access key is required,  a click on "generate access key"  and Logged generates for you using secrets library. 
 This will be your access key so copy and paste it in a safe place! You can't create your password because of the idea of an anonymous web tool, no password or user name it's gonna be related to you. 

-------- New site, selecting color, keyword, and description--------------

Once you logged in, Logged offers you the function of adding a new site, clickable URL, color, keywords and a description for that site.

---------------------------------Main panel----------------------------------

On your main panel, you will see the site's you are entered as a button, a click on the site button will open a modal with the site's clues you entered before.

---------------------------------Delete my account--------------------------

Remember,  there is no account! just delete your access key.
